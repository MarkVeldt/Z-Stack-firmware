# Z-Stack-firmware
This reposistory contains:
- Compiled Z-Stack firmwares (`.hex` files)
    - If you want to use these to flash to your CC253X (using the [Flash Programmer (not v2)](http://www.ti.com/tool/FLASH-PROGRAMMER) for example), make sure you save the __`raw`__ file (`.hex` file should be around 600kb when saved, not 3.5mb)
- Instructions on how to compile them
